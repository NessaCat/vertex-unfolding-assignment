\section{Introduction}
- why is unfolding important

- different kinds of unfoldings (edge unfolding \& general unfolding and their limits

\subsection{Problem Statement}
- goal

- extend code on facet path to cover all cases

- unfold the traignles and find a rotation so that no overlaps happens and the vertices are aligned
